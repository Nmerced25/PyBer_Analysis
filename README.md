# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
  The purpose of this project was to analyze ride sharing data in order to help better understand the differences of rider data and how it is affected in the different
  types of cities Pyber operates. This was done by creating a visual metric of the data that was collected in order to get a full understanding of the prices as well
  as the amount of riders that each area aggregates.
  
# Analysis
  When looking at the data below, Urban areas have shown to be the highest in comparison to the other two areas in terms of total rides, total drivers, as well as 
  total fares. This relates to the fact that there are generally more people within the area making the ride service almost a necessitiy to get around from place to 
  place. By comparison, the rural areas, although low in both areas of drivers, rides and fares, have shown to have more of the higher rates whcih correlates to the
  actual distance that a passengar would want to be taken which in turn, causes prices to go up. Furthermore, when it comes to suburban areas, the data shows that it
  is generally in the middle of the pack wich also relates to the population of people that could be living within the area.

# Summary
  When it comes to my reccommendations, Pyber struggles to reach the urban areas with the limited drivers that are available for Rural areas. Pyber could really 
  improve by hirinng more drivers within Rural areas in order to help bring more accessibility to the area whcich in turn, like within the Urban Area, help drive down 
  prices but allow more people to utilize the service. On the Contrary, when it comes to the Urban area, there are too many drivers compared to the riders, this 
  saturates the market and causes fares to drop. Within the Urban areas, Pyber can cut down on drivers to help drive up prices there so that the company can 
  generate more income. Lastly, Within the Suburban areas, there does dshow a need for more drivers, by increasing the amount of drivers here, it can help ensure that 
  the most customers are utilizing the services Pyber offers. Overall, by reallocating drivers as a whole, it can help provide access to the customers that are not 
  able to use Pyber and can help redistribute the fares in both the Rural and Urban areas to ensure that rates are balanced by the areas that they are operating in.
